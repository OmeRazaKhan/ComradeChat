            "Section 4.2 of the Department of Justice Act requires the Minister of Justice to prepare a Charter Statement for every government bill to help inform public and Parliamentary debate on government bills. One of the Minister of Justice\u2019s most important responsibilities is to examine legislation for inconsistency with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [\u201cthe Charter\u201d]. By tabling a Charter Statement, the Minister is sharing some of the key considerations that informed the review of a bill for inconsistency with the Charter. A Statement identifies Charter rights and freedoms that may potentially be engaged by a bill and provides a brief explanation of the nature of any engagement, in light of the measures being proposed.",
            "A Charter Statement also identifies potential justifications for any limits a bill may impose on Charter rights and freedoms. Section 1 of the Charter provides that rights and freedoms may be subject to reasonable limits if those limits are prescribed by law and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. This means that Parliament may enact laws that limit Charter rights and freedoms. The Charter will be violated only where a limit is not demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society.",
            "A Charter Statement is intended to provide legal information to the public and Parliament on a bill\u2019s potential effects on rights and freedoms that are neither trivial nor too speculative. It is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of all conceivable Charter considerations. Additional considerations relevant to the constitutionality of a bill may also arise in the course of Parliamentary study and amendment of a bill. A Statement is not a legal opinion on the constitutionality of a bill."

            "The National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) have jointly been supporting shipboard helicopter operations in Canada for many years. Both groups are active in various international collaborations, including many through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). To facilitate international collaborations, DRDC conceptualized a general warship geometry, known as the Notional Destroyer (ND), which they have used in studies relating to ship motion. NRC, in partnership with the NATO Applied Vehicle Technologies (AVT) Working Group AVT-315, has adapted the ND for studies relating to the launch and recovery of maritime helicopters. This variant of the ND is known as the NATO Generic Destroyer (NATO-GD). This posting provides geometrical, ship motion, and ship airwake data, generated in Canada in support of the AVT-315 working group, and to encourage other related research internationally. The activities of the AVT-315 working group, along with an introduction to the NATO-GD, are given by Owen et al. (2020).",

Supplementary Estimates directly support an appropriation act. Supplementary Estimates are published throughout the year; each release is identified alphabetically (A, B, C, etc.). Supplementary Estimates (A) are tabled in May and the associated appropriation act is granted royal assent and becomes law in June. These provide federal organizations with the funding they need early in the year. Supplementary Estimates (B) are tabled in late October or early November and the associated appropriation act is granted royal assent in December. Supplementary Estimates (C) are tabled in February and the associated appropriation act is granted royal assent in March.",

            "This interactive map commemorates Canada\u2019s participation in armed conflicts at home and abroad by highlighting a sample of the many geographical features and places named for those that served our country. These commemorative geographical names help us remember war casualties, soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen, military leaders, and civilians recognized or decorated for outstanding acts of bravery and sacrifice in battle. These names also commemorate notable battles in which Canada participated, and Canadian military units, regiments, squadrons, and ships in which Canadians served. Federal, provincial and territorial members of the Geographical Names Board of Canada provided these commemorative names for the development of the map. Many more commemorative place names exist in Canada, and will be added in future releases of this evergreen interactive map. If you would like to contribute names to this project, please contact the Geographical Names Board of Canada Secretariat at Natural Resources Canada.",
